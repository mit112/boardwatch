## Current standing

### 2026-09-22c — **RUN 470 READ: THE RE-KEY FIRED AS PREDICTED AND B8's VOLUME SITS ON THE BAR AT 20 (D-547). A RE-KEY ALSO DEMOTES — 237 LEADS 0-B HAD PROMOTED FELL OUT OF THE APPLY LANE, WHICH D-537 NEVER MEASURED. T153 EXECUTED ON THE OWNER'S RULING: THE JUDGE IS `sonnet`, THE STANDING QUEUE WAS RE-JUDGED ONCE (833 of 833) AND ITS APPLY LANE READS 529 (D-548). `gate.effort` SHIPS.**

**Run 470 (D-547).** 85m34s against 75–85. The re-key is verified in the store, not inferred from
the duration: **269,702** evaluations under the new identity (run 469: 1,524); the re-judge cost
+20.2 min, as predicted. The 34 s overshoot is a cost nobody budgeted: **a re-key also empties the
gate's cache** (0 cached vs 66; +8.0 min). **B8 volume: 20 against a bar of 20** — 25/22/26/20
post-expansion; D-529 is at n = 4 of 5.

**Read D-547 before predicting what any re-key costs the queue.** Dead gate rows cut BOTH ways:
D-537 counted the holds they release (101); they also kill every judge `eligible` that 0-B's
promotion needs, so **237** leads fell back to `no_requirements_found`/`experience_requirement`
(net **−136**, null-controlled 987 of 987). It started at the engine-batch merge and never
self-heals, because a `built` lead is never re-judged by the daily gate.

**The repair, ruled by the owner and done (D-548).** Live `config.toml` gate model `haiku` →
`sonnet`; the 833-lead standing queue re-judged once through the production `run_gate_stage` at
`--effort medium`, paced in owner-checked batches (seat 5% → 8% over the first 78 leads). **Apply
lane 283 → 529** (412 had the haiku readings survived); `no_requirements_found` 345 → 12. Sonnet
clears **25 of the 33** entry-titled leads haiku had called senior. **Sonnet's apply-lane
PRECISION is unmeasured — 529 is volume** — and Sonnet was the audit's independent arm, so the
next blind audit needs Opus.

**`gate.effort` ships** (`None` = the calibrated argv, no flag). The live config carries
`[gate] effort = "medium"`; `Settings` ignored it until the code merged, so it is verified by reading
it back AFTER the merge, never by the file. Known gap **T155**: effort is not in the gate's
freshness key, so a later change of level re-judges nothing already judged.

**Next reading: run 471**, day 1 of B8's fresh 14-day window (T153 is a change to eligibility under
`PROGRAM.md` §1). Read its `gate` block: the first daily gate on Sonnet, and the first whose
standing queue is fully current.

**NEXT WORK, IN ORDER — `TICKETS-2026-09-22c.md` holds all of it, with every pointer and cost
(D-549):**
1. **T159**: a blind audit of the Sonnet-era apply lane. B8's precision half; no code. Judges must
   exclude the production model.
2. **T113 re-scoped**: an automatic, bounded standing-queue gate refresh.
3. **One eligibility batch**: T152 + T156 + T157 + T105. AFTER T113, or it costs another hand-run
   re-judge.
4. **Cleanups**: T127 (live, 12 leads), T155, T158.
5. **PARKED, not forgotten**: T123, T124, T125, T133, T135, T137, T138, T139, T144, plus the owner
   calls. Listed in the same file's §#5.

**Its §0 lists what is already measured. Read it before any probe.**

### 2026-09-22b — **SETTLED, moved WHOLE to `STANDING-FACTS.md` on 2026-09-22c.** T149 + T154 shipped (**read D-541 before touching `abstain_by_adjacent`**: the degree escape was abstaining bars the profile already met, 5,579 rows), T150 live, T92 and T151 shipped, T101 refused on measurement (D-544), T153 corrected (D-545) and now EXECUTED (D-548), T152/T105 designed (D-546). **Held in D-540 … D-546 — do not re-derive.**

### 2026-09-22 (earlier) — **SETTLED, moved WHOLE to `STANDING-FACTS.md` on 2026-09-22b.** §5 refuted and already held by T109 (D-536); a catalog re-key RELEASES 117 held leads (D-537); the degree-waiver gap enumerated at 6,712 and ruled in (D-538); four tickets ruled and specced (D-539). **All four rulings are now discharged — see the block above.**

### 2026-09-21 — **SETTLED, moved WHOLE to `STANDING-FACTS.md` on 2026-09-22c.** Run 469 inverted the priority: **the binding constraint is the SLATE CAP, not discovery** — read D-532 before proposing ANY discovery work; anything sized in "eligible postings added" is in the wrong unit. The drain refused (D-533); B8's 9-of-14 record superseded (D-534); the Windows `os.replace` race fixed (D-535). Its recorded prediction for run 470 is answered in D-547. **Standing from it: a CONTENDED `make check` is a FALSE NEGATIVE** — check `uptime` first; above ~load 8 vitest's 5 s timeouts fail and the count varies run to run.

### 2026-09-20g / 2026-09-20f / 2026-09-19 — **SETTLED, moved WHOLE to `STANDING-FACTS.md` on 2026-09-21.**
Run 468's second reading (superseded by run 469, D-532); T104's refutation and rebuild (D-531, shipped);
the engine batch's opening (D-530 — it MERGED as `ea95c42c`); run 467, Gate 1's second reading clearing
all four employer-board bars, Indeed confirmed dead, and the stage-1 import that took the fleet 652 →
1,807 (D-521, D-522). **Do not re-derive any of it.** One correction carried forward: D-522 §3's sizing
rule (size from fleet density, predict yield from the sample) is **superseded by D-532** — both halves
are denominated in eligible postings, which is the wrong unit once the slate cap binds.

### 2026-09-20d/e — **SETTLED, moved WHOLE to `STANDING-FACTS.md` on 2026-09-20g.** The astra remediation wave: thirteen tickets in one gated wave, merged (D-528, PR #398 → `09df0e87`); Windows green and the five-night red over; the composite-title asymmetry REFUTED; T136's `ge=1` deliberately unchanged; next action 4's one-time re-judge FIRED and CLEAN on run 468. **Held in D-528 — do not re-derive.**

### Astra reviews 01–05 — **CONSUMED AND CLOSED.** All five slices, 42 findings, nothing refuted. Held WHOLE in **D-523 … D-527** and the five `TICKETS-2026-09-*-ASTRA-0*.md` files; the remediation that followed is **D-528**. **Do not re-derive any of it.** Of T98–T148 (51 tickets), **33 shipped**; **T145/T146/T147 are not build work** (owner DO-NOT-BUILD, future-reading guidance, LinkedIn posture); **T100–T105 are held as ONE engine bump** with next action 4; and **T113, T123, T124, T125, T127, T133, T135, T137, T139's stage extraction, T144 and T138's two remaining halves stay open.**

### 2026-09-19 — **SETTLED, moved WHOLE to `STANDING-FACTS.md` on 2026-09-22b.** The expansion is measured and works (run 467, D-522); Indeed confirmed dead; M5's 14th day taken and B1–B7 pass (D-521 §5); Gate 1's second reading discharges M4's last condition; the discovery backlog sized at three disjoint gaps and stage 1 imported, fleet 652 → 1,807. **Held in D-521 and D-522 — do not re-derive.**

### Owed, and specifically NOT done

- **THE DEGREE-WAIVER WIDENING SHIPPED 2026-09-22b (D-540), all ten arms.** The enumeration
  (6,712) was a TEXT-MATCH count, not a verdict-change count: the live two-arm reading over the
  6,964-posting delta is **10 rescued from `ineligible`, 0 demoted, 0 newly ineligible** once
  D-541's `met`-abstain fix is included. `or foreign equivalent` stays excluded and is now pinned by
  a control; the **pre-existing** direction-blindness is unchanged and still not fixed. **The
  verdict-level effect over the 65,879 postings the OLD escape already matched is NOT attributable
  from persisted state** — run 470's re-judge bundles the engine batch, #407 and T150 (D-547). Do
  not re-derive it from the store; only a replay at each commit could separate them.
- **T51 SHIPPED (D-484) before the freeze.** Its residual: a hedged bar carrying a domain noun has no
  `*_preferred` sibling to land in and writes no row; a recall change for M3's window.
- **D-436's per-family topic net is SIZED and NOT BUILT.** Sizing is in D-461: the all-family form
  takes `eligible` to **0**, and the `work_auth` form is worth **245 of 4,617 (5.3%)** — about a
  quarter of the measured defect. **Do not re-derive it, and do not quote the naive 29.9%**, which is
  EEO boilerplate contamination.
- **The hiring.cafe +6.19pp / 1,331-posting ceiling is RETIRED as a fossil (D-463).** Its null
  control rests on an endpoint PR #304 deleted on 2026-09-01, two days before D-451 was written.
  Real value ~**+0.6pp**. **Do not re-size other work off the 1,331.** The lane's dominant problem is
  **availability** — 2 total refusals and 2 near-total in the last 7 armed runs.
- **The refused-aggregator filter is REFUSED (D-463)**, not deferred. Its premise inverts on the
  actual variable. Do not re-raise it from the 24.7%/13.4% figures, which are the wrong comparison.

## Owner-gated — do NOT start or decide unilaterally

**0-D's REPAIR half is the one LIVE residual from the four settled owner-gated items moved to
`STANDING-FACTS.md` on 2026-09-21** (0-B/0-C/0-D shipped, the <= 1-YoE floor ruled and executed,
0-1 retired, per-source thresholds fully ruled — **nothing is owed on any of them**). The repair:
117 overwritten bodies and 301 lane-payload `raw_json` rows, never part of the ruling, still
available if Mit wants it. **D-498's rule (b) IS BUILT** (`_suppress_lane_copies`,
`top_cmd.py:1062`); rule (c) stays refused.

2. **TRACK 1 — CLOSED (D-482): accept the loss**, per D-453. Do not re-raise it from the 382 or
   the 113.
3. **Mit's résumé calls** — whether to send a document at all; the D-220 prose rewrite of the submitted "sole iOS developer" answer (outside the bundle); the per-lens formatting session.
4. **P2 item 8 — the onboarding field-taxonomy gatherer. DEFERRED by Mit 2026-08-28.** The last
   multi-tenancy gap of its kind; D-054 forbids us authoring non-tech field content.
5. **`add-evidence` takes no bundle lock** (D-143) — raise before two authoring agents run against
   one bundle.

## Open questions — Mit's, not to be resolved by fiat

**B8's RETIREMENT question is RULED and CLOSED (2026-09-21, D-534) — do not re-raise it.** The
9-of-14 volume record does not block: all 14 days are on the 652-board fleet, post-expansion
`pdf.entered` reads **25 / 22 / 26 (3 of 3, mean 24.3)**, and the engine batch's `rules_hash`
move restarts the 14-day confirm by `PROGRAM.md` §1's own rule anyway. **What is owed is B8's
volume half holding 14 days on the 1,807-board fleet, counted from run 471** — #407
restarted the window at run 470 and the T153 judge switch restarts it again (D-548). This is a
DIFFERENT question from item 0 below, which is about the alert CHANNEL.

0. **B8's volume reading on the escalation channel — RULED 2026-09-20e, held WHOLE in D-529.**
   Keep it OFF `summary.errors`; **no code change**, and `pipeline/runner.py:3083` plus its pinning
   test stand as T110 shipped them. **This is a deferral with a CONDITION, not a closed question:**
   the "near-daily noise" argument rests on 9 of 14 confirm days under the bar and **all 14 are
   pre-expansion**; post-expansion readings are now **25 / 22 / 26 / 20 (n = 4)** — none under the
   bar, run 470 exactly on it. **Revisit at n ≥ 5, i.e. after run 471.** Do not re-derive the
   argument — read D-529.

1. **The projection spec's six open questions** (§12).
2. **The Snap `Level 3`/`Level 5` leak stays open by design** — with no bindings file every level
   token abstains. boardwatch ships no verifiable claim about any company's ladder.
3. **Whether `censored` boards publish a coverage ratio, and the 17 silent boards.** The class is
   **15 boards and 43,371 postings that can never be listed at all** (run 127) against an ~84,821
   open corpus. **Sized, not solved, and no budget can solve it.** See D-336.
4. **Whether `ServiceNow Developer` should rank at all against a new-grad SWE target.** Role
   TAXONOMY, not dedup. D-345 bounds the delivery damage; it does not answer this.
5. **ANSWERED 2026-09-05 — T31 (`1fc61596`, on `close-2026-09-05`): `boardwatch init` seeds the
   bundled `resume_template.tex` when absent and never overwrites; the placeholder-phrase catalog
   still refuses the unedited copy, so the fail-closed guarantee is unchanged.**

## Phase status

**P0–P6 are all COMPLETE and their gates all MET, and none has moved in weeks — the full table
moved WHOLE into `STANDING-FACTS.md` on 2026-09-01e.** Read it there. Only these are not settled:

- **P2 item 8** (field-taxonomy gatherer) **NOT STARTED** — the last multi-tenancy gap, owner-gated.
- **P7 Breadth**: LinkedIn, GitHub-lists, jobapps, **`jsonld` and `indeed` are all built and ARMED**
  (D-420). Indeed's cap is **50 again** after one uncapped measurement run (D-459). **hiring.cafe is
  armed and WORKING**, and its 50-board sample is **reverted** (D-456) — watched boards 482 → 432,
  then 490 after run 149's Indeed convergences. Remaining tier-D lanes are **DECIDED AGAINST**, not
  deferred (D-451).
- **Provisional pass: recorded MET on runs 6, 7, 8 (D-483) — but runs 7 and 8's own funnels read `DOES NOT RECONCILE` (B6) through the reporting gap T60 closes (D-489); whether they stand is Mit's ruling.** 14-day confirm: day 1 = run 9 (2026-09-06 06:00 CDT, clean tick, same gap), passive. **B8 (D-487): 17.2% on n = 128 is the BAR reading; 14.7% was a gate-judged SUB-CUT (D-513). Pre-drain re-read 16.2% / 18.8% = NOT MET; POST-DRAIN 6.9% / 5.6% = **MET** (D-514).**
  Not chased (D-351 item 2: work comes first), and every `rules_hash` bump restarts the count.

## Live blockers and carried gaps

**THE FIVE-NIGHT WINDOWS RED IS OVER, AND THE 2026-09-21 NIGHTLY WAS A DIFFERENT, REAL DEFECT
(D-535).** T128's three fixes and the `%s` strftime fix hold — all three read **zero occurrences**
on every run since. What took the 09-21 nightly (`35607814820`) red was ONE test on Windows 3.12
alone: `test_a_lock_free_reader_only_ever_sees_a_complete_tree`, `CURRENT is unreadable:
Permission denied`, on **1 failed / 10,499 passed**. It had passed on the 09-19 and 09-20
nightlies and on both dispatches, so it is an **intermittent race, not a break** — and the race is
real: `os.replace` on `CURRENT` denies concurrent opens on Windows, so the lock-free reader saw
neither revision. Fixed; see D-535. **Only a Windows dispatch can confirm the race is gone and ONE
green run is not enough** — at the observed rate a single pass proves almost nothing, so read
several nightlies before calling it closed. **The 2026-09-22 nightly (`35727396657`, on the fix) is the first
green scheduled nightly after four reds, all three `windows-latest` jobs green — n = 1.**

**READ A WINDOWS RESULT BY TEST NAME AND COUNT, NEVER BY COLOUR.** The dispatch before this one
(**35547739139**) was also red, and it did NOT mean the fix had failed: T128's three targets were
already at 0 occurrences while 46 *different* tests failed on the unrelated `%s` break. A red
dispatch is a list of names to compare against the ones you expect. The green one was confirmed a
real run the same way: Windows 3.13 read 10,500 passed / 85 skipped against local's 10,584 / 1, and
**10,584 − 10,500 = 85 − 1 = 84**, so every missing pass is an accounted-for platform skip rather
than a collection failure.

**WINDOWS IS STILL INVISIBLE TO ORDINARY CI, AND THIS DOES NOT CHANGE.** It is in the matrix for
`schedule` **and `workflow_dispatch`** only (`ci.yml`'s `os:` expression is the authority) — a green
27-job CI on a `main` push says **nothing** about Windows, and a PR cannot show it either.
**Validate any Windows-touching fix with `gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <branch>` before merging.**
Read the nightly with `gh run list --branch main --json event,conclusion` filtered to
`event=="schedule"`; `--limit 1` shows the newest run of EITHER kind, which is how a red nightly
reads as green.

| Item | Detail | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| **boardwatch sees 16.4% of job-apps' eligible yield — RE-DERIVED 2026-08-30, and the METHOD was wrong before** | **45 of 275 (16.4%)**, cohorts 08-23..08-29, on the **379-board fleet**. This replaces "10.1%, owed a check". It decomposes: fleet growth 344->379 gave 10.1 -> **13.8%**; adding an **exact ATS-slug key** alongside name matching gave 13.8 -> **16.4%**. **Name-only matching undercounts, so 7.7% and 10.1% are FLOORS** — boardwatch stores Micron as `Micron TDIT`, so the old method scored a watched company as unwatched; same for HPE/`Hewlett Packard Enterprise`, Cox/`Cox Automotive`, Disney/`Walt Disney Company`, Toyota, VIAVI. **The unreached 230 split: aggregator-only 60.7%, unsupported employer host 21.1%, board-addable just 1.8%** (5 postings in 7 days, 4 of them SmartRecruiters — the class D-370 declined on measured cost), so the cheap remainder is ONE Workday board (Motorola Solutions). **The gap is lanes, not boards.** Script: `.agent/2026-08-30-session/reach_v2.py`. Amazon/TikTok/Apple/ByteDance use none of the 6 ATS, so a slug cannot reach them. Closing it means a new discovery lane — GitHub new-grad lists are 19.1% of yield for ~5 public-repo GETs and are NOT the ToS trap the v2 decision was written about. **Reopens D-008** | **Mit** (reverses a shipped decision) |
| **Citi sits at 13.1% coverage, permanently** | Workday's `total` censors at 2,000; the facet sum (uncapped, control-verified) says 4,589. Our pager wraps at ~2,000 too, so post-drain Citi holds ~2,214 of 4,589 and nothing reports it | **Mit** (input-side) |
| **Run 9 (2026-09-06) tick-fired CLEAN on the restored five-lane config (D-487, read D-489); run 10 is the first whose funnel can reconcile a split slate (T60)** | The launchd job invokes the **editable** venv at `boardwatch/.venv/bin/boardwatch`, so whatever branch that tree is parked on IS the unattended run's code and `rules.yaml`. **Park the primary checkout on `main` before ending every session**; a stray branch changes EVERY subsequent run. The tick fired 06:00 CDT until the 09-09 reboot and **04:00 CDT since** — launchd keeps its boot zone, and the plist's hour is 4. Verify a tick by `runs = N` in `launchctl print` and the log mtime, never by the run row alone: a hand run proves the code, only a tick proves the plist | **Mit** (reboot); every session (discipline) |
