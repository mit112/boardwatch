## Current phase

**P0 — Instrumentation. IN PROGRESS on branch `p0-instrumentation`.**

Item 7 (the `run_id` migration) is **DONE and committed**. Items 1/2/8 (funnel artifact, per-rule abstain,
fabrication counters) are **specified but blocked on one open question** — see "Open questions" below:
`runs` rows are written only by `scan`, but eligibility and tailoring run in separate later processes, so
there is no existing process whose boundaries match a seven-stage funnel. That has to be settled before the
artifact is built, or the artifact gets keyed to the wrong notion of a run and P0 is rework.

Branch is **not pushed and has no PR** — pushing is not covered by standing permission.

## What shipped in session 2 (2026-08-06)

Two commits on `p0-instrumentation`, `make check` green at each:

- **`bc0973d`** — `main` was **red** and had been since session 1. `PROGRAM.md:4` and `STATE.md:27`
  carried an absolute `/Users/<name>` path, violating generalization rule R1, so `make check` exited 2
  before pytest ever ran. Session 1 wrote "`make check` is the only gate" and then committed twice without
  running it. Fixed to `~/...`. See D-014 — **docs are scanned; a docs-only commit is not exempt.**
- **`c56bc11`** — `run_attribution` migration: nullable `run_id` on `eligibility_evaluations` and
  `artifacts`, plus round-trip test and the head-revision pin. See D-015.

Research findings are in `METRICS.md` under "Session 2". The load-bearing ones:

- **6 families, 44 rule patterns. 7 of the 44 have never fired once** in 20,637 evaluations. A
  `GROUP BY rule_id` emits no group for them at all, so per-rule abstain **must** enumerate from
  `load_rules()` and LEFT JOIN, or the rules it exists to expose stay invisible.
- **A 100% abstain rate already exists:** `experience_years:scoped_years_minimum`, 11,670/11,670 `unknown`.
- Two of session 1's schema claims were imprecise: the dedup index is **partial**
  (`WHERE engine_kind = 'deterministic'`), and there is **no `abstain` verdict** — it is stored as
  `uncertain`.
- `disposition='unknown'` conflates **four** causes, separable only by free-text `rationale` with no CHECK
  constraint. Abstain *rate* is computable; the typed abstain *reason* the keystone invariant wants is not.
- `artifacts.uri` points at the **`.typ`, not the PDF**; PDF-built lives only in
  `meta_json.typst_pdf_built`.
- **Only 1 of 7 funnel stages** was run-attributable before the migration.

## What shipped in session 1

Analysis, planning and program machinery — **zero source changes**. Committed as `84cfab6`.

- Read all seven job-apps handover documents (2,609 lines) in `~/dev/Job apps/docs/boardwatch/`.
- Verified job-apps' claims about boardwatch against boardwatch's actual code. job-apps never read this
  repo and said so; four of its factual claims about boardwatch are wrong as a result. See `DECISIONS.md`
  D-002, D-004, D-005, D-006, D-007, D-009 and `PROGRAM.md` §5.
- Wrote `PROGRAM.md`, `STATE.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `METRICS.md`, and the repo's first `CLAUDE.md`.

**Correction to boardwatch's own record:** the "37 applied folders" figure boardwatch used in
`.agent/plans/p12-parity-report.md` is wrong. job-apps' real figure is **388** `_applied/` folders (369
distinct, 380 with PDFs); 37 was one bucket of its current curated queue. boardwatch's "37 shipped vs 222
targets, and job-apps' applied count is also 37" argument is dead — both halves were coincidence on
job-apps' own numbers. That parity doc is retired by D-008; the file is gitignored working material and
has been left in place, unedited, as a record.

## Independent review — 2026-08-06

Reviewed by a fresh agent with no shared context, at Mit's instruction. **Verdict: APPROVE WITH CHANGES.**
Full record in D-013.

Five load-bearing factual claims were attacked: **D-004, D-007, D-009 VERIFIED** · **D-005, D-006
OVERSTATED** (both in boardwatch's own favour — the D-012 failure mode, caught). All twelve required
changes adopted, none contested.

## Next action

**Settle what a "run" is (open question 1 below), then build the funnel artifact.**

Everything else about the artifact is already specified and researched. What is not settled is its key.
Once that is decided, in order:

1. Thread `run_id` into the two write paths — `write_evaluation` (`eligibility/engine.py:242`) and
   `record_artifact` (`store/artifacts.py:17`) take no such parameter today, so the new column stays NULL
   forever until they do. **The migration alone changes no behaviour.**
2. Per-rule abstain rate, enumerated from `load_rules()` and LEFT JOINed — never `GROUP BY rule_id`.
3. Funnel artifact (`json` + `md`) with cache hits as their own asserted stage
   (`store/eligibility.py:130`'s `inserted.rowcount == 0` **is** the cache-hit signal, computed today and
   discarded — this is plumbing an existing boolean out, not new detection).
4. Fabrication counters. Needs new plumbing, not a query: aggregates die at `cli/tailor_cmd.py:196-204`
   and `:407-414` after `console.print`, and Tier A's fail-safe has no counter anywhere.

Write the artifact **outside the git tree** (as tailored résumés already are): R6 forbids any `.pdf` in the
tracked tree and R7 requires a sha256-pinned `SHIPPED_DATA` entry for tracked `.json`. `.md` is exempt from R7.

---

## Open questions

### 1. What is a "run"? — OPEN, blocks the P0 funnel artifact

**The problem, measured.** `runs` rows are inserted in exactly one place: `insert_run` at
`scan/coordinator.py:104`, inside the scan's own file lock. `run_id` is then threaded as a plain parameter
(no contextvar, no ambient state) through `apply_board` → `append_event`/`record_version_source`. But:

- **Eligibility runs in a different process.** `run_eligibility` (`eligibility/preflight.py:133`) is called
  from `top`, `stats` and `eligibility` preflight — never from `scan`. No `run_id` is in scope there.
- **Tailoring runs in a third process, one posting at a time.** `run_tailor` takes a single `posting_id`;
  **no batch orchestrator exists in `src/`**. The de facto batch driver is `.agent/bin/bw-daily` (`bwd`),
  which is gitignored shell — it just calls `boardwatch tailor run <id> --out ...` in a loop.

So a seven-stage funnel does not correspond to the boundaries of any process that exists. Live evidence:
`runs` has **4** rows while `eligibility_evaluations` has **20,637** — essentially every evaluation was
written outside any run.

**The fork.** (a) `run_id` = the scan run, with downstream writers recording the scan they are working off —
cheap, but an evaluation's "run" then means *the run that captured the version*, not when it was judged.
(b) Broaden `runs` into a **pipeline run**: a new command wrapping scan → eligibility → tailor that owns the
row and emits the artifact — this is what P3 builds anyway, so P0 would be laying P3's foundation early.
(c) Make the funnel a **window** report like `stats`, not run-keyed at all — but then B6 ("funnel reconciles
to a terminal state") has nothing to reconcile *per run*, and PROGRAM.md §3.P0.4's run manifest has no owner.

**Recommendation: (b)**, scoped so P0 does not wait for P3 — introduce the pipeline-run row and the artifact
writer now, have `scan` populate what it owns, and report downstream stages as an explicit `unattributed`
bucket until their writers thread `run_id`. Do **not** silently pick (a): it makes "cache hit" and
"judged during this run" the same number, which is the exact indistinguishability D-013 added the migration
to prevent.

### Previously resolved

All four of session 1's questions were answered by Mit on 2026-08-06 — see `PROGRAM.md` §7 and
`DECISIONS.md` D-010/D-011.

Summary of the answers, because they carry program-wide weight:

1. **Reading the job-apps repo is authorized, standing.** It was revoked only for the self-assessment
   session so the plan would be honest. Accompanying standing instruction: **check and verify rather than
   assume** — a failed command is not a negative result, a recalled number is not a measured one.
2. **Two personas (SDE / iOS)** with different protected-fact sets, matching Mit's job-apps setup.
3. **`needs_sponsorship: true` for Mit**, declared knowingly and declared per user — never inferred.
4. **`~/boardwatch-applications/<date>/`** stays the daily output home.

Answers 2 and 3 both carry the same governing rule, now `PROGRAM.md` §3b and D-010: **publish the
generalized mechanism, keep Mit's instance local. This applies system wide.**

---

## Standing facts a fresh session should not re-derive

- **Live urgency.** `STAGE1_ONLY=1` is active in job-apps' launchd plist. Its 08:30 run stops after
  discovery. **Nothing is generating Mit's résumés daily right now.** P1 and P3 close a live gap.
- **The tailoring architecture is already correct.** Typed skeleton, plain-text-only model contract,
  Python-owns-markup, independent entailment judge — all present. Do not rebuild it. (`PROGRAM.md` §5.1.)
- **`typst` is installed** at `/opt/homebrew/bin/typst`. "No PDF" is a silent-degrade code path, not a
  missing binary.
- **`track` exists but has never been used** — `applications` and `application_events` are both 0 rows.
- **`jobs` and `postings` are both 19,448** — `job_id` is 1:1, grouping has never run, duplicate leakage
  is structurally unmeasurable until P6.
- **`make check` is the only real gate.** pytest + ruff + mypy green is not green; the generalization
  checker only runs under `make check`.
- **`.agent/` and `.superpowers/` are gitignored** working material. `CHANGELOG.md` is authoritative for
  what shipped.
